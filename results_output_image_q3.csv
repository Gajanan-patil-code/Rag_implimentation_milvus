India's residential real estate market demonstrated positive activity throughout 2024,
culminating in a strong final quarter performance accentuated by seasonal festive
demand. This surge propelled annual sales to surpass 300,000 housing units for the
second consecutive year. Developers responded to this market momentum by
introducing over 280,000 new residential units during the year.

The current residential real estate market is characterised
by strong fundamentals and robust end-user demand.
Resultantly, we anticipate that both sales and new
launches of housing units will remain steady. However,
given the elevated capital values and an uncertain global
economic landscape, homebuyers may start adopting a
wait-and-watch approach to purchasing decisions.

Moreover, as price points adjust, we expect sustained
demand for high-end and premium residential categories,
specifically those priced between INR 1.5 to 2 crore and
INR 2 to 4 crore. In addition, markets traditionally
dominated by the mid-end housing segment, such as
Noida, Bengaluru, Pune, and Chennai, would continue to
witness the addition of quality supply, supported by
demand for high-quality housing.
