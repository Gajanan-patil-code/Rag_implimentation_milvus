Prompt design (prompt engineering):
• The focus is on designing a very specific input or prompt to guide the pre-trained model to
produce the desired output.
• Like prompt tuning, the main model remains “frozen”.
• This method is about exploiting the vast knowledge and capabilities of the pre-trained model
by just crafting the right input. As mentioned earlier, we will cover prompt engineering in
detail in Chapter 5.
In prompt tuning and prompt design, original model weights remain frozen, whereas in model tuning
model parameters are updated:

Figure 3.10 – Model tuning, prompt tuning, and prompt design
The following figure demonstrates model tuning (full fine-tuning) on the left and prompt tuning on
the right. Tuning a model for a specific task necessitates creating a task-specific version of the entire
pre-trained model for each downstream task, and separate batches of data must be used for inference.
On the other hand, prompt tuning only necessitates storing a small, task-specific prompt for each task,
allowing for mixed-task inference using the original pre-trained model. With a T5 “XXL” model, each
tuned version of the model necessitates 11 billion parameters. In comparison, our tuned prompts only
necessitate 20,480 parameters for each task, which is a reduction of over five orders of magnitude,
assuming a prompt length of 5 tokens:
Figure 3.11 – Model tuning versus prompt tuning
Techniques for fine-tuning models 63
Now, let’s look at the benefits of prompt tuning compared to prompt engineering and model fine-tuning:
• Compared to model fine-tuning, prompt tuning does not require copies of the LLMs to be
created for every task, thus resulting in a reduction in storage space
• Compared to few-shot prompt engineering, prompt tuning is not restricted to context length
or a limited number of examples
• Instead of crafting the best manual prompt to generate the desired output, you can use
backpropagation to automatically learn a new model
• Resilient to domain shift
The research paper The Power of Scale for Parameter-Efficient Prompt Tuning from Google highlights
the experiment (Figure 3.12) that was conducted on the T5 Transformer model. As per the evaluation,
prompt tuning on the T5 model matched the quality of model tuning (or fine-tuning) as size increases,
while enabling the reuse of a single frozen model for all tasks. This approach significantly outperforms
few-shot prompt designs using GPT-3. SuperGLUE is a benchmark that’s designed to comprehensively
evaluate the performance of various natural language understanding models across a range of challenging
language tasks. We will learn more about SuperGLUE in the upcoming sections of this chapter:

other hand, soft prompts are not confined to fixed, discrete words in natural language and can assume
any value in the multi-dimensional embedding vector space. In the following figure, words such as
“jump,” “fox,” and others are hard prompts, whereas the unlabeled black-colored token is a soft prompt.
Prompt tuning process
In prompt tuning, soft prompts, also known as virtual tokens, are concatenated with the prompts;
it’s left to a supervised training process to determine the optimal values. As shown in the following
figure, these trainable soft tokens are prepended to an embedding vector representation – in this case,
“The student learns science:”
Figure 3.8 – Soft prompt concatenation
The following figure provides a more detailed representation of the process. Vectors are attached to
the beginning of each embedded input vector and fed into the model, the prediction is compared
to the target to calculate a loss, and the error is backpropagated to calculate gradients, but only the
new learnable vectors are updated, keeping the core model frozen. In other words, we are searching
the embedding space for the best representation of the prompt that the LLMs should accept. Even
though we can’t easily understand soft prompts learned this way, they can help us figure out how to
do a task using the labeled dataset, doing the same job as text prompts written by hand but without
being limited to specific words or phrases:
Figure 3.9 – Prompt tuning process (detailed)
Techniques for fine-tuning models 61
Next, we’ll compare three methods: model tuning (full fine-tuning), prompt tuning, and prompt design
(prompt engineering). As shown in Figure 3.10, research conducted by Google shows the difference
between model tuning, prompt tuning, and prompt design (Guiding Frozen Language Models with
Learned Soft Prompts, QUINTA-FEIRA, FEVEREIRO 10, 2022, posted by Brian Lester, AI Resident,
and Noah Constant, Senior Staff Software Engineer, Google Research).
Model tuning (full fine-tuning):
• This method starts with a pre-trained model that is then further trained (or “tuned”) on a
specific task using additional input data. The model becomes more specialized in this process.
• This method represents “strong task performance” as the model gets more aligned with the
particular task.
Prompt tuning:
• Instead of tuning the entire model, only the prompt or input to the model is adjusted. The main
model remains “frozen” or unchanged.
• This introduces the concept of “tunable soft prompts,” which can be adjusted to get desired
outputs from the model.
• This method combines the general capabilities of the pre-trained model with a more task-
specific approach, leading to “efficient multitask serving.”

• Selective
• Additive
• Reparameterization
The following figure shows 30 PEFT methods that were discussed in 40 research papers published

Figure 3.6 – PEFT methods that were discussed in research papers published between 2019 and 2023
This diagram was taken from a survey published in the paper Scale Down to Scale Up: A Guide to
Parameter-Efficient Tuning.
We will dive into each of these categories in this section but only cover the most important PEFT
techniques that have shown promising results.
Techniques for fine-tuning models 59
Additive
The core concept of additive methods involves fine-tuning a model by adding extra parameters or
layers, exclusively training these new parameters, and keeping the original model weights frozen.
Although these techniques introduce new parameters to the network, they effectively reduce training
times and increase memory efficiency by decreasing the size of gradients and the optimizer states. This
is the most widely explored category of PEFT methods. A prominent method under this category is
prompt tuning with soft prompts.
Prompt tuning with soft prompts
This type of tuning involves freezing the model weights and updating the prompt parameters instead
of model parameters like in model fine-tuning. When you freeze the weights of a model, you prevent
them from being updated during training. These weights remain the same throughout the fine-
tuning process. It is a very compute and energy-efficient technique compared to traditional fine-
tuning. Prompt tuning should not be confused with prompt engineering, which we will discuss in
Chapter 5. To understand prompt tuning better, we need to understand the concept of soft prompts
and embedding space.
Soft prompts and embedding space
An embedding vector space is a high-dimensional space where words, phrases, or other types of data
are represented as vectors such that semantically similar items are located close to each other in the
space. In the context of natural language processing, these embeddings capture semantic meanings
and relationships between words or sentences, allowing for operations that can infer similarities,
analogies, and other linguistic patterns.

The above figure depicts a 3D embedding vector space along the X, Y, and Z axes. Representing natural
language through tokens is considered to be challenging because each token is associated with a specific

• Format the output: Mention the format of the output, which can be bullet points, paragraphs,
sentences, tables, and languages, such as XML, HTML, and JSON. Use examples to articulate
the desired output.
• Adjust the Temperature and Top_p parameters for creativity: As indicated in the parameters
section, modifying the Temperatures and Top_p can significantly influence the variability of
the model’s output. In scenarios that call for creativity and imagination, raising the temperature
proves beneficial. On the other hand, when dealing with legal applications that demand a
reduction in hallucinations, a lower temperature becomes advantageous.

• In the intermediate (middle) Evaluation and Refinement stage, you assess the prompts for
factors such as usefulness, fairness, groundedness, and content safety. Here, you also establish
and measure prompt quality and effectiveness using standardized metrics. Prompt flow allows
you to build prompt variants and assess and compare their results through large-scale testing,
using pre-built and custom evaluations.

collaborate with others to get feedback. Prompt Flow can assist by launching your flow as an
endpoint for real-time inference, test that endpoint with sample data, monitor telemetry for
latency and continuously track performance against key evaluation metrics.
